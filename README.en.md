> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for supply chain, procurement, order, warehouse, and logistics operations.

ZhuaTech Transportation Management System provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for supply chain, procurement, order, warehouse, and logistics operations. It is designed for procurement, planning, warehouse, logistics, supplier, and operations teams, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise transportation management system, self-hosted transportation management system, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Procurement, planning, warehouse, logistics, supplier, and operations teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

- **User** — Manage user with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Driver** — Coordinate driver through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Vehicle** — Track vehicle metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Transport Order** — Preserve transport order evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Tracking Event** — Expose tracking event in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Partner and master-data management** — Connect partner and master-data management to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Architecture and Runtime

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout
